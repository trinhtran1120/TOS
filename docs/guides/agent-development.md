# Agent-driven development guide

This guide explains how to use the TOS documentation and workflows with different agentic systems (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, custom agents, etc.).

## Overview

TOS is optimized for agent-driven development. All rules, workflows, and procedures are centralized in the `docs/` folder, and compatibility layers in `.agent/`, `.github/`, and `.claude/` reference them.

## Infrastructure at a glance

| System | Primary entry point | Always-on rules behavior | Workflow selection | Canonical rule source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Loads project instructions from `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, which references `docs/standards/` | User prompt references `docs/workflows/*` | `docs/standards/` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Instruction file enforces orientation and links standards/workflows | Prompt and task context plus linked workflow docs | `docs/standards/` |
| Antigravity | `.agent/rules/rules.md` + `.agent/workflows/*` | `.agent/rules/rules.md` is `always_on` and points to standards | Slash commands or workflow wrappers in `.agent/workflows/*` | `docs/standards/` |
| Custom agents | Integrator-defined | Must be configured to consume project entry points and `docs/` | Integrator-defined | `docs/standards/` |

Interpretation: wrappers define how agents discover and trigger behavior; `docs/standards/` remains the single source of truth for policy.

## Using with Claude Code

### Entry point

Claude Code reads its configuration from:
1. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (this project's rules) - **Start here**
2. `docs/` (full documentation)
3. `.agent/` (legacy workflows)

### Quick start

When working with Claude Code:

```
User: "I want to implement a new constraint type. Please follow the feature workflow."

Claude Code will:
1. Read .claude/CLAUDE.md for project context
2. Reference docs/workflows/feature.md for step-by-step procedure
3. Follow docs/standards/ for code quality rules
4. Return results
```

### Configuration files

- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** - Main rules file with links to all documentation
- **`.claude/settings.local.json`** - Local permissions (not agent rules)

### Running workflows

You can reference workflows directly:
- Feature work: See [docs/workflows/feature.md](../workflows/feature.md)
- Bug fixes: See [docs/workflows/bugfix.md](../workflows/bugfix.md)

## Using with GitHub Copilot

### Entry point

GitHub Copilot reads its configuration from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

### How it works

The copilot-instructions.md file is a thin wrapper that references:
- `docs/standards/` for all rules
- `docs/workflows/` for step-by-step procedures
- `docs/guides/` for architecture and contribution guides

### No changes needed

You don't need to teach Copilot anything differently - just make sure to reference the `docs/` folder in your prompts or let Copilot discover the rules automatically.

## Using with Antigravity

### Entry point

Antigravity reads its configuration from:
1. `.agent/rules/rules.md` (project rules wrapper)
2. `.agent/workflows/` (workflow references)

### How it works

Antigravity uses a workflow-driven approach:
- **`.agent/rules/rules.md`** references `docs/standards/` for all coding standards
- **`.agent/workflows/`** contains thin wrappers that point to `docs/workflows/`
- **Slash commands** like `/feature`, `/bugfix`, `/orientation` provide quick access to workflows

### Quick start

Use workflow slash commands to quickly access step-by-step procedures:

```
User: "I want to implement a new constraint type. /feature"

Antigravity will:
1. Read .agent/workflows/feature.md which references docs/workflows/feature.md
2. Follow the feature workflow steps
3. Apply all rules from docs/standards/
4. Return results
```

Available slash commands:
- `/feature` - Standard feature implementation
- `/bugfix` - Bug fix workflow
- `/refactor` - Code refactoring
- `/api-validation` - External API exploration
- `/docs` - Documentation changes
- `/orientation` - Project orientation

### No changes needed

The `.agent/` folder is already configured for Antigravity. Just use slash commands to select the appropriate workflow, and Antigravity will automatically follow the project standards in `docs/`.

## Using with custom agents

### Integration pattern

If you're building a custom agent for TOS:

1. **Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md`** or **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** to understand the project
2. **Reference `docs/index.md`** as your documentation hub
3. **Use `docs/workflows/`** for step-by-step procedures
4. **Check `docs/standards/`** for specific rules

### Example integration

```markdown
# Your Custom Agent Configuration

Follow TOS project rules in docs/:
- Standards: docs/standards/
- Workflows: docs/workflows/

When implementing features:
1. Check the appropriate workflow in docs/workflows/
2. Follow all standards in docs/standards/
```

## Workflow reference

All workflows follow the same structure:

### Feature workflow
**Use when:** Implementing a standard feature without external API exploration
- Location: [docs/workflows/feature.md](../workflows/feature.md)
- Process: Write tests -> implement -> verify -> document
- Time: Varies by complexity

### Bugfix workflow
**Use when:** Fixing a reported bug
- Location: [docs/workflows/bugfix.md](../workflows/bugfix.md)
- Process: Reproduce -> fix -> verify -> document
- Time: Varies by bug complexity

### Refactor workflow
**Use when:** Improving structure without changing behavior
- Location: [docs/workflows/refactor.md](../workflows/refactor.md)
- Process: Understand current structure -> refactor -> verify behavior unchanged
- Time: Varies by scope

### API validation workflow
**Use when:** Exploring external APIs or uncertain about design
- Location: [docs/workflows/api-validation.md](../workflows/api-validation.md)
- Process: Create scratch script -> validate -> document findings -> clean up
- Time: Varies by API complexity

### Documentation workflow
**Use when:** Making documentation-only changes
- Location: [docs/workflows/docs.md](../workflows/docs.md)
- Process: Edit docs -> verify links -> commit
- Time: Usually quick

### Orientation workflow
**Use when:** First time working on the project, or returning after a long absence
- Location: [docs/workflows/orientation.md](../workflows/orientation.md)
- Process: Read README/CONTRIBUTING -> run tests -> pick workflow
- Time: 15-30 minutes

## Standards quick reference

When implementing, keep these standards in mind:

### Tools
- **Always use `uv run`** for all commands
- See [docs/standards/environment-tooling.md](../standards/environment-tooling.md)

### Quality gates
- Must pass `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`
- Must pass `uv run pytest`
- Must pass `uv run pre-commit run --hook-stage push --all-files`
- See [docs/standards/code-quality.md](../standards/code-quality.md)

### Code style
- Google-style docstrings with descriptions only
- Type hints in function signatures, not docstrings
- See [docs/standards/typing-docstrings.md](../standards/typing-docstrings.md)

### Testing
- Use pytest
- Use parametrize for multiple test cases
- Include descriptive assert messages
- See [docs/standards/testing.md](../standards/testing.md)

### ML/numerical code
- Prefer JAX
- Make randomness explicit with seeds
- Keep tests deterministic
- See [docs/standards/ml-numerical.md](../standards/ml-numerical.md)

## Making changes to documentation

If you need to update project rules or workflows:

1. **Make changes in `docs/`** - This is the single source of truth
2. **All agents will automatically see the updates**
3. **No need to update multiple files** - The wrappers in `.agent/`, `.github/`, and `.claude/` reference the central docs

This ensures consistency across all agentic systems.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what workflow to use"
Start with [docs/workflows/orientation.md](../workflows/orientation.md) to understand the project, then pick the workflow that matches your task.

### "What rules apply to my code?"
Check [docs/standards/](../standards/) for the specific rule you're unsure about. Each file covers one topic.

### "Can I break the rules for X?"
Most rules are non-negotiable. If you think a rule doesn't apply, discuss it in a PR comment - but the assumption is that all standards in `docs/standards/` apply.

## For project maintainers

When updating project standards:

1. Update the relevant file in `docs/standards/`
2. No need to update `.agent/rules/rules.md` or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. All agents will automatically see the changes
4. Consider updating `docs/index.md` if you add new standards

When creating new workflows:

1. Create the file in `docs/workflows/`
2. Add a link to `docs/index.md`
3. No need to create wrapper files in `.agent/workflows/` or `.github/prompts/` unless you're adding a new agent type
